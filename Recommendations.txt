Recommended-Proteome,mcrA,HSP70
Proteome_3,1,3
Proteome_42,1,3
Proteome_45,1,3
Proteome_50,1,3
Recommendations are based 2 things:
1. there must be at least one copy of each gene
2. more copies of HSP70 are favorable
Therefore proteome_03, proteome_42, proteome_45, and proteome_50 represent the best candidates based on that criteria.
